This highly accessible, general-purpose technology is suitable for numerous tasks. It’s already used in copyediting, customer service, brainstorming, summarizing documents, and more. And many more uses are yet to be identified. \nThe course covers:"

      "snippet": "Last week I spoke at Coursera Connect, the company’s annual conference in Las Vegas, where a major topic was AI and education. There has been a lot of hype about generative AI’s ability to transform industries overnight. Certainly many industries — including education — will be transformed. But we’re about 15 years into the deep learning revolution, and we’re not yet done identifying and building useful deep learning applications"

This year, generative AI, which is built on top of supervised learning, arrived as a second major tool that enables AI to generate complex and compelling outputs such as images or paragraphs of text."
